## Another Dice App!?
There are plenty of dice apps out there already - on the web, the app store, the play store...(and yes &mdash; even the microsoft store.) So why do we need *yet another*?

I won't sugarcoat it. Most of them stink! The ones that don't stink often lack other key features or are not free. Rather than settling with mediocrity, *How I Roll* reaches for the stars, offering an abundance of features:

- [x] Open Source!
- [x] Online accessible
- [x] Progressive Web App
- [ ] High search engine optimization
- [ ] On the Google Play Store
- Mobile integration
	- [x] shake to roll
	- [x] swipe to roll
- Powerful dice features
	- [ ] 3D dice
	- [ ] favorite dice rolls
	- [ ] roll `XdY` dice `Z` times
	- [ ] drop `N` lowest/highest dice in pool
	- [ ] reroll conditional dice in pool at most `N` times
	- [ ] explode conditional dice in pool at most `N` times
	- [ ] add modifiers
	- [ ] arbitrary dice sizes
